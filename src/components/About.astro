			I started my development journey as a backend developer, focusing on Java and system
			architecture. Over time, my interest shifted to frontend development, and I became a fullstack
			developer, building complete applications from databases to user interfaces. I enjoy working
			in teams, learning continuously, and contributing to projects that bring real value.
			Currently, I am focused on expanding my knowledge of modern technologies and growing
			professionally.
